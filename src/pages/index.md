  title: Proof Bakery
  description: >-
    A small micro bakery that bakes breads and croissants made using
    stone-ground flour containing no additives or preservatives. 


    Baking bread using the old fashion ways and techniques, making use of slow
    rising with no proofers makes it extremely easy to digest bread packed with
    good gut microbes and probiotics.


    Slow mixing and a minimum 12-hour fermentation allows for full flavour
    development, minimal oxidation (nutrient loss). All hand shaped, and baked
    at high temperatures for a beautiful crust, and moist crumb.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
